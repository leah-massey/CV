## Leah Massey

Hello there üëãüèª I'm a detail oriented, Software Engineer, trained at the prestigious Makers Academy. I'm currently looking for my first role in tech. I'm interested in positions where I can continue to hone my craft within a company that celebrates both creativity and productivity. 

My resourcefulness, people-skills, eye for detail and work ethic has allowed me to work for some of the most prestigious creative companies in the world. I continually strive for excellence in everthing I do and find great joy in discovering and learning from masters of industry.

My logical and technical way of thinking along with my creative mindset has always proved an asset in the workplace. The devil is in the detail and I love nothing better that peeling back the layers and building from scratch - adapting, adjusting and adding to create something that is not only fitting a brief but also elegant in its design. Learning to code has so many parallells to my experiences in tailoring - the attention to detail, the need to plan, practise, experiment and then execute. It excites me to flex my fingers in another medium - especially one with infinite possibilities.   

Beyond work, my interests are varied and eclectic. I'm as keen on 1940s jazz dance as I am about smashing balls on tennis courts and getting out the quill and ink to teach myself modern calligraphy.

## Skills

I'm a problem solver. I like to create systems where there are none to help create an efficient working environment. 



Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Self Starter

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Hobbies

I'm a swing dancer, and have taught evening classes, run social events and danced around Europe at festivals for the past 12 years.
If I'm not dancing, I can usually be found on the tennis courts in and around Hackney, drawing or drafting a new pattern for some clothing I've designed.
