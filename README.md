## Skills

I'm a problem solver. I like to create systems where there are none to help create an efficient working environment. 

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

I'm a swing dancer, and have taught evening classes, run social events and danced around Europe at festivals for the past 12 years.
If I'm not dancing, I can usually be found on the tennis courts in and around Hackney or drafting a new pattern for some clothing I've designed. 


Hello, my name is Leah 
I'm a maker and a problem solver with a background in tailoring and production management. 

I've a sharp analytical mind and an eye that cannot help but look over a problem one last time, 
I find something I like, I take it apart and I rebuild it, but better.
If I find something I like, I'd sooner learn how to make it than buy it.
