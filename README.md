Hello there üëãüèª I‚Äôm a Software Engineer who likes details, finding patterns and embracing new concepts. I‚Äôm a graduate of Makers Academy, and an enthusiast of TDD, great communication and continual learning. I most recently worked as Head of Porduction for a sustainable womenswear company and have over a decade‚Äôs worth of experience conceptualising, building and creative problem-solving within the worlds of bespoke craftsmanship (tailoring & interior design) and production management. I thrive in environments where I can use both logic and creativity and am really excited that Software Engineering  provides me with an endless opportunity for both. 

<a name="tech"></a>
## Tech Experience

#### Makers Academy (January 2023 - May 2023)

Intensive full time and fast-paced 16 week Software Engineering bootcamp following Agile methodologies with weekly challenges, and multiple team projects.

- Independent learning structure allowed me to quickly developed strong research skills, employing a combination of online resources, personal projects and pair programming to enhance my studies and better my understanding. These are practises that I continue today. 
- Trained using TDD from the offset. I really enjoy with the logical processes behind this practise and the solid base it gives to a project. TDD has many parallels to my tailoring & production experiences.
- Daily pair-programming at Makers gave me an opportunity to learn from and share knowledge with others. 
It was a particularly rewarding way of learning and an exciting turning point when it became more efficient, too.
- Large emphasis on cultivating high workplace EQ and wellbeing - with workshops surrounding this topic, regular check-ins, daily retros and stand-ups - all of which made for easy communication throughout team projects.

## Skills


#### Logic and Creativity
I have both a mathematical and a design background. Being able to utilise both logic and creativity allows me to consistently make valuable contributions and to regularly see opportunity where others might not. My technical and precision-focussed way of working was honed during my training as a bespoke tailor and also during my experiences running production for a clothing company where garment QC and development were but a few of my responsibilities.

#### Problem Solving 
Whether it be working out how to put into practise a 'zero waste' policy as Head of Production in the notoriously wasteful clothing industry or creative problem-solving to make the impossible possible during my work as a Private PA, I have developed outside of the box thinking and a determination to make things happen even when all paths seem to point to a dead end. 

#### Detail Oriented
The devil is in the detail and I love nothing better that peeling back the layers and building from scratch - adapting, adjusting and adding to create something that not only fits a brief but is also elegant in its design. Learning to code has so many parallels to my experiences in tailoring - the attention to detail, the need to plan, be curious, practise, experiment and then execute. It excites me to explore the craft of coding for all of these reasons.

#### Apetite for Learning
I have a natural curiosity and desire to learn which, combined with a discliplined work ethic, has helped me achieve knowledge and skills across multiple disciplines. My resourcefulness, people-skills, adaptability and work ethic has allowed me to work and learn from some of the most prestigious creative companies in the world across the fields of fashion, design and film. I continually strive for excellence in everthing I do and find great joy in discovering and learning from masters of industry. 

#### Communication

Communication has been a critical skill in each of my roles to date, including during my time at Makers where daily pair programming was a highlight and an opportunity to learn from and share knowledge with my fellow students. 
In my previous role as Head of Production I was responsible for communicating across an entire team of employees. Whether I was liaising with fabric manufacturers in Turkey or managing a design team, I took great pride in my clarity of communication and acted with diplomacy and fairness in all situations.
My high-level EQ skills have meant that I have always maintained excellent relationships with employers and work colleagues. I welcome feedback and maintain a growth mindset at all times.

## Hobbies

I'm a swing dancer, and have taught evening classes, run social events and danced around Europe at festivals for the past 12 years. If I'm not dancing, I can usually be found on the tennis courts in and around Hackney, drawing or drafting a new pattern for some clothing I've designed myself.
