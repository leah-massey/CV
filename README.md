Hello there üëãüèª I'm a detail oriented Software Engineer trained at the prestigious Makers Academy. I'm currently looking to secure my first role in tech, having spent the past 10+ years accruing a wealth of experiences and transferrable skills within the Arts. I'm interested working for companies that celebrate both creativity and productivity.

## Skills

#### Logic and Creativity
I have both a mathematical and design background. Being able to utilise both logic and creativity allows me to consistently make valuable contributions and to regularly see opportunity where others might not. My technical way of working along with my creative problem solving skills has always proved an asset in the workplace. 

#### Problem Solving 
Whether it be working out how to put inot practise a 'zero waste' policy as Head of Production in the notorioulsy wasteful clothing industry or creative problem-solving to make the impossible possible during my work as a Private PA, I have developed outside of the box thinking and a determination to make things happen even when all paths seem to point to a dead end. 

#### Detail Oriented
The devil is in the detail and I love nothing better that peeling back the layers and building from scratch - adapting, adjusting and adding to create something that not only fits a brief but is also elegant in its design. Learning to code has so many parallells to my experiences in tailoring - the attention to detail, the need to plan, be curious, practise, experiment and then execute. It excites me to explore the craft of coding for all of these reasons.

#### Apetite for Learning
My resourcefulness, people-skills, and work ethic has allowed me to work and learn from some of the most prestigious creative companies in the world across the fields of fashion, design and film. I continually strive for excellence in everthing I do and find great joy in discovering and learning from masters of industry.

#### Self Starter 
I am proudly self-taught and fluent in the Adobe Suite and also as an advanced pattern cutter. I am able to both create and interpret with ease technical drawings and designs. Being comfortable around design work has proved incredibly helpful when interpreting briefs and building projects. I have a natural curiosity and desire to learn which, combined with a discliplined work ethic, has helped me achieve knowledge and skills across multiple disciplines. 

## Communication

Communication has been a critical skill in each of my roles to date, including during my time at Makers where daily pair programming was a highlight and an opportunty to learn from and share knowledge with my fellow students. 

In my previous role as Head of Production I was responsible for communicating across an entire team of employees. Whether I was liasing with fabric manufacturers in Turkey or managing a design team, I took great pride in my clarity of communication and acted with diplomacy and fairness in all situations.

My high-level EQ skills have meant that I have always maintained excellent relationships with employers and work colleagues. I welcome feedback and maintain a growth mindset at all times.

## Hobbies

I'm a swing dancer, and have taught evening classes, run social events and danced around Europe at festivals for the past 12 years. If I'm not dancing, I can usually be found on the tennis courts in and around Hackney, drawing or drafting a new pattern for some clothing I've designed myself.
