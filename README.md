## Leah Massey

Detail oriented, Full Stack Software Engineer, trained at Makers Academy. Currently continuing to develop my programming knowledge through personal projects and dedicated study. Interested in roles where I can continue to hone my craft within a progressive company that celebrates both creativity and process-driven efficiency. 

I have accrued a wide range of experiences within the creative industries - tailoring, film, interior deisgn and audio-books over the past 10+ years. My resourcefulness, gritty determination and work ethic has allowed me to work for some of the most prestigious companies in their field. I continually strive for excellence in everthing I do and find great joy in discovering and learning from masters of industry.

My logical and technical way of thinking along with my creative mindset has always proven an asset in my work. The devil is in the detail and I love nothing better that peeling back the layers and building from scratch - adapting, adjusting and adding to create something that is not only fitting a brief but also elegant in its design. Learning to code has so many parallells to my experiences tailoring - the attention to detail, the need to plan, practise, experiment and then execute. It excites me to flex my fingers on another medium - one with infinite possibilities.   

My interests are eclectic and wide ranging. I'm as enthusiastic about learning vintage dances as I am about ancient trees. I have always been a maker.

## Work Experience

## Skills

I'm a problem solver. I like to create systems where there are none to help create an efficient working environment. 

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Hobbies

I'm a swing dancer, and have taught evening classes, run social events and danced around Europe at festivals for the past 12 years.
If I'm not dancing, I can usually be found on the tennis courts in and around Hackney or drafting a new pattern for some clothing I've designed.  


Hello, my name is Leah 
I'm a maker and a problem solver with a background in tailoring and production management. 

I've a sharp analytical mind and an eye that cannot help but look over a problem one last time, 
I find something I like, I take it apart and I rebuild it, but better.
If I find something I like, I'd sooner learn how to make it than buy it.
